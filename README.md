# Harvest-Moon-Gift-Preferences
generates data structures and human-readable lists of gift preferences among Harvest Moon characters

One of the goals in Harvest Moon games is to make friends with the townspeople by giving them gifts. Different townspeople like different gifts. I wrote a series of scripts to create human readable lists of characters and what they like, and gifts and which characters they are liked by. Writing this list to a .txt file makes it simple to ctrl + f to find what items a character likes, or who an item should be gifted to.
